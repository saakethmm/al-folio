### Questions

1. Something about representations? 
2. Similarly about mech interp and identifying how language works in the brain/LLMs?

I wanna be the guy who can bridge the 2

<!-- Something about understanding how information is communicated and understood, extending Claude Shannon's ideas one step further. How can one use information (via language) to best learn 
the outside world? Massive implications in modern discourse with understanding issues and communicating (e.g., politics & news), education (how to teach better), ... -->


<!-- Not just how meaning is represented in the brain, how is it actually processed? How does the brain actually understand and interpret language (also learn via language)?  -->

### Ideas
In the future, I can imagine things like:
* Using mind to visualize the app which some agent can then create immediately
* Police officer asking witness to visualize crime scene so that some diffusion model can recreate scene
