#### What *question* do they seek to answer? 
* How to assign different stages of computation to different portions of the ventral visual pathway?
* How are the cells in earlier parts of visual pathway different from anterior IT in terms of what they respond to?

**Why?**
* Ventral visual cortical pathway known to comprise V1, V2, V4, and anterior/posterior IT
	* Cells here known to respond to complex visual stimuli, though how this is actually distributed along the pathway is unknown
* Marr proposed an algorithmic perspective to computations; this study aims to demonstrate this

#### What's their *idea* to answer that question? 
* Perform principled intracortical recordings over sets of simple and complex stimuli on the macaque cortex 
* Uses a reduction method starting from complex 3d objects and gradually removes features to identify the simplest feature (known as *critical feature*) that a cell responds to

**What's their contribution?**
* Identifies that IT and V4 also selectively responded to simple features sometimes with smaller receptive fields![[Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 10.51.29 AM.png]]
* The critical features in IT and V4 often varied greatly
* Posit that local networks in IT and V4 allow for selectivity to complex object features

#### What *data/models* do they use to test it? 

**Data**:
* Start from 3d complex objects
* Routine set comprised:
	* Bars and disks
	* Regular geometric patterns (e.g., concentric circles, windmills, etc.)
	* Plastic and sponge shapes (spheres, cubes, etc.)
	* 3d animal stimuli (stuffed tigers, elephants, monkeys, etc.)
	* 3d plant stimuli
	* experimenter's face and hands
* Single-cell electrode recordings

**Models**:
* No models, just monkeys!
	* Use quite complex setup to record data from monkeys involving lengthy list of chemicals to ensure minimal confounding factors
* Involves reduction method
	* If a cell responded to a simpler stimuli with features excluded as well as original, then simpler one thought to be *critical*
##### Why?

**Data**:
* Known that these regions correspond to visual stimuli, just a matter of isolating what exactly they respond to
* <u>Caveat</u>: sometimes when the complex feature was added, the response increased, meaning the cell went from simple to complex (==which means the reduction approach is not foolproof?==)

**Models**:
* Can't do intracortical recordings and measurements on humans like this
* Closest relatives to humans
#### What *experiments* do they run? Pick main ones.
1. Reduction method over 228 cells, firstly over anterior IT cells
2. Also done in posterior IT
3. Distribution of selectivities of numerous cells for different monkeys recorded across V2 to anterior IT range

##### **Why?**Â 
1. Important to verify hypothesis that anterior IT responds to complex stimuli
2. Same as above but for posterior IT/V4
3. Useful to know how the distribution varies across visual system

#### What else would *I* like to see?
Nothing as of rn.
  

  
#### What do their results say (*my* interpretation)? Same ones.
1. Figure 4 (example of anterior IT cell)![[Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 10.59.45 AM.png]]
	* As can be noticed, the presence of the horizontal bar + 2 black spots are essential to elicit a response
	* Means that anterior IT cell is selective to this sort of "face" stimulus
2. Example of cell in V4 ![[Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 11.06.10 AM.png]]
	* Clearly the critical feature could be reduced from the hand
3. Distribution of cells responding to simple vs. complex features (lower $S_{max}/MAX$ corresponds to lessened responses to complex stimuli)![[Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 11.10.25 AM.png]]
	* As can be seen, as we move towards the anterior IT (right), the number of complex cells increases
	* Towards the left (V2), the number of simple/texture cells increases
#### What do their results say (*their* interpretation)? Same ones.
2. Only about 1/2 of the stimuli in posterior IT and V4 maximally responded to simple stimuli
	* Found by noticing that elongated, oriented bars elicited larger response than an ear of corn (similar shape) 
	* The diverse cells did not form groups, it was just a continuum from simple to complex
3. Change in the distribution of simple and complex cells accompanied by receptive field changes
	* Receptive fields in anterior IT much larger than posterior IT
	* Also included fovea in anterior IT more often 


#### What are their conclusions?
1. Critical features have been observed in anterior IT before, but this is the *first* study to quantify the distinctiveness of features in V4 and posterior IT 
	* Introduces use of computer graphics system for measuring stimulus responses
2. No reason to assume samples of cells recorded corresponds to actual outputs of the cortical areas
	* Need to include cells at varying stages in local networks
3. Since there is some selectivity prior to anterior IT, authors suggest selectivity is NOT the final goal of computation (something else is there!)

##### **Any future directions to extend?**
