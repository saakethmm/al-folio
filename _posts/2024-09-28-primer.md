### Nobel Prizes of 2024

nobel prize and forewarning for things to come

- Perhaps the first nobel prizes won by AI 


Additionally, some recent news with Nobel Prize
Read this article recently: https://unherd.com/newsroom/has-the-nobel-prize-cancelled-physics-and-chemistry/

#### Some interesting ideas

Motivated by platonic rep hypothesis paper... super interesting

* larger models help capture alignment (scale helps a lot!)
* statistical efficiency matters just as much as scale
* generality of task (can't expect something narrow like autonomous vehicles and protein structure models to align)
* model capacity
* simplicity bias


### Representational Alignment

* alignment of intelligent systems is a mysterious and fascinating scientific question
* discuss key topics necessary around representational alignment:

<!-- TODO: how to split this up effectively, what papers to focus on? -->
* not just about brain, also about aligning human values, making world a better place
* something missing from making tech better

### The Future: In Silico Models for Science

* Neural networks (along with their architectural variants) thought to be *in silico* models of the brain, but it's not just for the brain!
	* It's just easier for the brain because it's a direct parallel in terms of the tasks we're trying to solve (i.e., intelligence/AGI)
	* It's just approximating some function of the patterns underlying data, whatever they may be $\rightarrow$ with enough data/compute they can learn the structure underlying everything!
  <!-- TODO: find a paper discussing this -->
		* Then, it's just a matter of Interpretability!
