There's two key players going around in the news right now about predicting the 2024 US Presidential Election. On the one side there is Allan Lichtman, a historian at the American University, with 13 True/False questions that determine the outcome, while on the other, we have Nate Silver, a statistician (previously at [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/)) who uses regression analyses using polls and other data to make a data-driven outcome.

## Allan's Prediction: Kamala Harris Victory

## Nate Silver's Prediction: Donald Trump Victory

I think this is an interesting, but clearly very, very hard problem to solve. Very noticeably, Allan Lichtman's Keys to the White House don't take into account *any* campaigning information, essentially rendering anything the candidates pointless, as if the result was already predetermined.

Tomorrow's the election so we'll see who turns out to be correct. Might reveal some things about what kinds of models are useful in these sorts of problems.
