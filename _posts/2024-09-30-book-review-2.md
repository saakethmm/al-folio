Continuing in the trend of books whose authors are named Oliver, I read this book a few months ago called *Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman after a friend recommended it to me. Little did I realize it would be one of the most influential books I've ever read in my life. It's one that I come back to often, because I fail to fully imbibe the lessons drawn in the book, and often come away from the re-read feeling grateful and refreshed from the words of wisdom laid forth by the author.

I've went through the traditional productivity overhaul over the last few years, motivated to fully change the procrastination-driven routine I'd had in high school. 

* came away from this reading several self-improvement/productivity books and though it helped, my stress shot through the roof because I'd try to keep optimizing (always how can I make this more efficient?)

* this book has taught me to let go, in that I never had any control over my time anyways
