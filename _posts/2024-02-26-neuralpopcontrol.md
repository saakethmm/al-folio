#### What *question* do they seek to answer? 
1. Is the information contained by an ANN useful for neural population control?
2. Does the functional similarity between ANNs and the brain generalize to new images?

**Why?**
Many of the prior findings in the visual stream that models are able to explain the brain well have come from predictions on test set, not from just fitting brain data. But, there are two limitations (potential):
1. Models are just a copy of the activity and do not provide a useful understanding of it
2. The images used to evaluate the model tend to be from the same distribution as training

#### What's their *idea* to answer that question? 
1. Use one of the best models of ventral visual stream (with *fixed* parameters) to synthesize new patterns of images intended to "control" neural sites in V4 via:
	* *neural* *stretching*: goal of extending firing rate well beyond its maximal typical rate
	* *neural population state control*: synthesized images independently control every neural site in small population 


**What's their contribution?**
* Present novel image synthesis algorithm to control neural activity (to test causal relationship between images generated by model and neural activity)

#### What *data/models* do they use to test it? 

**Data**:
* Rhesus monkey intracortical data from microelectrode arrays collected across various neural sites in V4

**Models**:
* Convolutional neural networks
##### Why?

**Data**:
* Can't be going around sticking needles in human brains

**Models**:
* Tend to model brain better
#### What *experiments* do they run? Pick main ones.
1. Use encoding model to identify the layer which maximally predicts V4 neurons in nonhuman primate visual cortex

* Also, generate synthetic controller images to drive firing rate of one of the neural sites to be as high as possible, regardless of other sites' firing rates
	* Places these controller images in the center of the receptive field 
2. Neural population (one-hot) control: try to maximize the response of a single neural site while suppressing all others as much as possible
3. Use synthetic stimuli to see if encoding models that predict responses from naturalistic stimuli can predict those of synthetic stimuli
##### **Why?**Â 
1. Address first question of whether the ANNs can actually generate images that causally have an effect on neural sites
2. Not observed how it affects other sites, so control for that
3. Examine second question above to see whether the models tend to reproduce/generalize on out-of-distribution stimuli 


#### What else would *I* like to see?
Not sure, good experiments.

  
#### What do their results say (*my* interpretation)? Same ones.
1. Figure 2![[Screenshot 2024-02-26 at 11.19.38 AM.png]]
  * A: examples of how the synthetic images look
  * B: For most neural sites, we see the synthetic controller extends the firing rate beyond what naturalistic images are able to do
  * C, D: the synthetic stimuli are able to maximize control over curvature stimuli and naturalistic
2. Figure 3![[Screenshot 2024-02-26 at 11.24.40 AM.png]]
* As can be seen, some images can be generated that do a pretty good job only activating the target neural site
3. 
#### What do their results say (*their* interpretation)? Same ones.
1. ANN-driven stretch controllers must have found pixel arrangements that are better drivers of the V4 neural sites than was previously found before
3. ANN model accounted for 54% of explainable variance on synthetic stimuli responses
	* Although model overestimated neural responses to synthesized stimuli often
	* Also much lower than 89% for naturalistic stimuli test
	* Still *very impressive*, since this is purely out-of-domain
#### What are their conclusions?
1. ANNs are actually quite good models of the intermediate ventral visual system, and can be used for explaining visual stimuli that neural sites respond to 
	* Overcomes barrier of human language/intuition to interpret features
2. Two questions posed at the start (causal relationship & generalizability) are both mitigated but not eliminated

##### **Any future directions to extend?**
* Future neural networks could do a *much* better job!
