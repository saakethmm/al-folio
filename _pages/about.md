👋🏽 Welcome to my website! My name is Saaketh and I'm an [MS in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) student at Carnegie Mellon University interested in the mechanisms of intelligence ([NeuroAI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37180-x)).

Currently, I'm particularly interested in understanding how language is understood and interpreted in the brain as well as in large language models (LLMs). This interest extends to topics such as [representational alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13018.pdf) and [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart).

In the past, I worked on research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200179), [computational neuroscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuromatch/comments/xo3nk4/saaketh_medepalli_vip_inhibitory_neurons_in_the/) and [representation learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00451.pdf) as an undergrad.

In my free time, I enjoy fitness (🏋🏾/🎾/🏓), cooking 🥘, and learning about Indian history/culture 🪷. I also love reading books 📚 (hit me with any recs!) and exploring the outdoors 🥾.
