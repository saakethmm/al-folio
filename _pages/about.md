👋🏽 Welcome to my website! My name is Saaketh and I'm an [MS in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) student at Carnegie Mellon University interested in the mechanisms of intelligence ([NeuroAI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37180-x)). I'm particularly interested in topics such as representational alignment, [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart) and more generally what principles our brains share with deep neural networks.

In the past, I've done research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200179), [computational neuroscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuromatch/comments/xo3nk4/saaketh_medepalli_vip_inhibitory_neurons_in_the/) and [representation learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00451.pdf) while an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan.

In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis 🎾, cooking 🥘, and learning about Indian history/culture 🪷. I also love reading books 📚 (hit me with any recs!) and exploring the outdoors 🌳.
