Hey everyone! My name is Saaketh and I'm a student deeply fascinated in intuitively grasping the magical abilties of our minds, especially from the angle of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, in whatever form that may be. To get started on that path, I'm currently researching a neuromorphic system that more naturally mimics the structure of the neocortex, and hopefully, some of its functionality too. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Officially, I'm a junior studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan and do research in Prof. Wei Lu's lab [PI](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wluee/). Feel free to read more about my path up until this point of posting this website (make blog post!) and my future goals with it.
