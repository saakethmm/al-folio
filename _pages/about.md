👋🏽 Welcome to my website! My name is Saaketh and I'm an [MS in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum.html) student at Carnegie Mellon University, working in [Leila Wehbe's group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/index.html).

Currently, I'm particularly interested in understanding how language is understood and interpreted in the brain as well as in large language models (LLMs). This broadly covers the fields of cognitive neuroscience, AI interpretability, and representational alignment.

In the past, I worked on research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200179), [computational neuroscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuromatch/comments/xo3nk4/saaketh_medepalli_vip_inhibitory_neurons_in_the/) and [representation learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00451.pdf) as an undergrad.

In my free time, I enjoy fitness (🏋🏾/🎾/🏏), cooking 🥘, and playing [Carnatic flute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venu) 🪈. I also love a good book 📚 or TV show 📺 and exploring the outdoors 🏞️ when the opportunity arises.
