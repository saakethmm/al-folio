Welcome! My name is Saaketh and I'm a senior at the University of Michigan interested in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning (specifically deep learning). I'm deeply fascinated by the time-immemorial question of what intelligence is and how we can build truly intelligent machines. To this end, I've done and am doing research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://lugroup.engin.umich.edu), [computational neuroscience](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/mindscope-program/) and [deep learning](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu).

Outside of academic work, I enjoy playing tennis, table tennis, cooking (and eating!), and night sky watching with my telescope. I also love traveling to national parks and enjoying thriller movies/TV shows.
