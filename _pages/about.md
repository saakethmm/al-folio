Welcome to my website! My name is Saaketh and I'm a MS in Machine Learning student at Carnegie Mellon University interested in the mechanisms of intelligence. Lately, I've been interested in AI interpretability in the goals of improving AI safety for the future. 

In the past, I've done research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202200179), [computational neuroscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuromatch/comments/xo3nk4/saaketh_medepalli_vip_inhibitory_neurons_in_the/) and deep learning representations.

[comment]: <> (post arXiv of report for EECS 598 and post next to deep learning representations)

In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis ðŸŽ¾, cooking ðŸ¥˜, and stargazing ðŸ”­. I also love reading books ðŸ“š in neuroscience and artificial intelligence, tech,history (especially Indian), modern society/politics, and a sprinkle of fiction.
