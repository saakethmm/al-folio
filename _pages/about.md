Welcome to my website! My name is Saaketh and I'm a senior at the University of Michigan interested in the intersection of neuroscience and deep learning. 

I'm deeply fascinated by the time-immemorial question of what intelligence is and how we can build truly intelligent machines. To this end, I have done and am doing research in different areas related to this question, including [neuromorphic engineering](https://lugroup.engin.umich.edu), [computational neuroscience](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/mindscope-program/) and [deep learning representations](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu).

I enjoy playing tennis, cooking (and eating!), and night sky watching with my telescope. I also love reading and learning about new topics!
